## Private SS7 Network Infrastructure
✅ **Private Network Mode**: Available for testing and development
✅ **STP Implementation**: Signaling Transfer Points configured
✅ **SG Implementation**: Signaling Gateways configured
✅ **MSC Implementation**: Mobile Switching Centers configured
✅ **Point Code Management**: Private point code allocation
✅ **Protocol Support**: MTP, SCCP, and TCAP protocols implemented

**Important Note**: The private SS7 network is a simulation environment for testing purposes. It does not connect to real telephone numbers or the public switched telephone network. For actual connectivity to real numbers, production deployment with a legitimate SS7 service provider is required.

## Technical Process
The system implements the spectrum wave telecommunications process as described:
- Uses usb adapter to capture spectrum waves in authorized bands
- Extends range by analyzing multiple frequency bands simultaneously
- Detects towers when device waves meet tower bands
- Extracts point codes from tower signals
- Establishes full SS7 connectivity for telecommunications services

For detailed technical implementation, see [SPECTRUM_WAVE_TELECOM_PROCESS.md](file://n:/sms/SPECTRUM_WAVE_TELECOM_PROCESS.md)

## Production Deployment
For production deployment with real SS7 network connectivity, please refer to the detailed [PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](file://n:/sms/PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md) which provides comprehensive instructions for:
