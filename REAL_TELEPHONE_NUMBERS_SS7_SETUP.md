# Production Deployment: Real Telephone Numbers and SS7 with SIGTRAN

## Overview
This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up real telephone numbers and SS7 connectivity through SIGTRAN protocols.

## Prerequisites
1. Valid telecommunications license
2. Contract with a carrier that provides SS7 connectivity
3. Assigned point codes from regulatory authority
4. Network infrastructure with SIGTRAN endpoint connectivity
5. SSL/TLS certificates for secure connections

## Step 1: Obtain Real Telephone Numbers

### Carrier Requirements
Contact your telecommunications carrier to:
- [ ] Obtain real telephone numbers
- [ ] Request SS7 connectivity
- [ ] Get assigned point codes
- [ ] Receive SIGTRAN endpoint information
- [ ] Obtain authentication credentials

### Number Types
- [ ] Geographic numbers (e.g., +1-212-XXX-XXXX)
- [ ] Mobile numbers
- [ ] Toll-free numbers
- [ ] International numbers (if needed)

### Provisioning Process
1. [ ] Submit application for numbers
2. [ ] Provide required documentation
3. [ ] Configure number routing with carrier
4. [ ] Test number assignment
5. [ ] Verify billing setup

## Step 2: Configure SS7 Connectivity

### Carrier Information Needed
- [ ] STP (Signal Transfer Point) IP addresses
- [ ] MSC (Mobile Switching Center) IP addresses
- [ ] Assigned point codes
- [ ] Network appearance values
- [ ] Routing context values
- [ ] Authentication credentials (pre-shared keys)
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates

### SIGTRAN Protocol Configuration
- [ ] M3UA (MTP3 User Adaptation)
- [ ] SUA (SCCP User Adaptation)
- [ ] M2PA (MTP2 Peer-to-Peer Adaptation)
- [ ] TCAP over IP

## Step 3: Deploy SSL/TLS Certificates

### Certificate Requirements
- [ ] Server certificate
- [ ] Private key
- [ ] Certificate Authority (CA) certificate

### Deployment Locations
- [ ] `/etc/ssl/certs/sigtran.crt` (server certificate)
- [ ] `/etc/ssl/private/sigtran.key` (private key)
- [ ] `/etc/ssl/certs/ca.crt` (CA certificate)

## Step 4: Update SIGTRAN Configuration

### Configuration File: `sigtran_config.py`
Update with carrier-provided information:
- [ ] Point code mappings
- [ ] IP addresses and ports
- [ ] Security settings
- [ ] Authentication credentials

## Step 5: Set Environment Variables

### Required Environment Variables
- [ ] `SS7_SIGTRAN=true`
- [ ] `SS7_PRIVATE_NETWORK=false`

## Step 6: Start Production Services

### Startup Process
1. [ ] Set environment variables
2. [ ] Start backend services
3. [ ] Start frontend services
4. [ ] Verify SIGTRAN connectivity
5. [ ] Test SMS sending/receiving

## Step 7: Testing and Validation

### Connectivity Tests
- [ ] SIGTRAN connection establishment
- [ ] Point code resolution
- [ ] Message routing
- [ ] Security validation

### Functional Tests
- [ ] SMS sending from system
- [ ] SMS receiving from external phones
- [ ] Voice call initiation
- [ ] Call reception

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Connection Failures**
   - Verify IP addresses and ports
   - Check firewall rules
   - Confirm network connectivity

2. **Authentication Errors**
   - Verify pre-shared keys
   - Check point code mappings
   - Confirm certificate validity

3. **Message Delivery Issues**
   - Verify number provisioning
   - Check routing configuration
   - Confirm carrier setup

## Security Best Practices

### Certificate Management
- [ ] Regular certificate renewal
- [ ] Secure private key storage
- [ ] Strong encryption algorithms

### Access Control
- [ ] IP whitelisting
- [ ] Authentication requirements
- [ ] Rate limiting

### Monitoring
- [ ] Detailed logging
- [ ] Security event alerts
- [ ] Regular audits

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- [ ] Certificate updates
- [ ] Security patches
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Log file rotation

### Emergency Procedures
- [ ] Immediate shutdown
- [ ] Incident response
- [ ] Recovery procedures

## Support Contacts

### Carrier Support
- [ ] Technical contact
- [ ] Billing contact
- [ ] Emergency contact

### Internal Support
- [ ] System administrator
- [ ] Security team
- [ ] Network team
