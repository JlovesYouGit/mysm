# ðŸ‘‹ Final Words from the Original Developer

## Real Talk from the Creator

Hey, so here's the final real words - there's most of the functionality was active but with some ups and downs getting it to GitHub. Files were made, I'm really dropping this on my side. Good luck with the bit I could send over :)

Didn't take me long... peace till I make something else or just outright get a job or disappear etc ._.

I don't think I know development anymore haha yeah anyways you can use some files from spectrum project I made, modify it a bit and stuff. Still had missing components since I have currently the original files but you know it is what it is. I got some faith in y'all :0

Hope this works into a big project! 

## ðŸš¨ Important Philosophy - Keep It Free

**Make sure you have free tier - none of the paid shit!** Only pay shit if needed for premium shit and other cool features or coverage :(

I'm in this mess cause I can't fucking pay for this so **don't do that to another person**.

## What Actually Works 

- SMS system is functional
- Spectrum analysis works with real hardware  
- Web interface for communications
- Number management system
- Multi-mode operation (SIGTRAN, private network, licensed)
- Real RF spectrum monitoring

## What's Missing

Some components aren't fully implemented, but the foundation is solid. The spectrum project files can be modified and improved.

## Final Message

This project has potential to become something bigger - a real decentralized communication network that breaks free from corporate control. Just remember to keep it accessible to everyone.

**Peace out! ðŸ“¡âœŠ**
