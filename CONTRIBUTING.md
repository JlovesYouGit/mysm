## üõ†Ô∏è **Development Workflow**

### **Setting Up Development Environment**

```bash
# 1. Fork the repository on GitHub
# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/decentralized-telecom.git
cd decentralized-telecom

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r Backend/requirements.txt
cd Frontend/nexus-dialer-hub && npm install

# 4. Create development branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 5. Set up environment variables
cp Configuration/.env.template Configuration/.env.local
# Edit .env.local with your settings
```

### **Code Standards**

#### **Python (Backend)**
```python
# Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
# Use type hints
def send_message(message: str, recipient: str) -> bool:
    """Send message through RF network.
    
    Args:
        message: The message content to send
        recipient: Target node identifier
        
    Returns:
        True if message sent successfully, False otherwise
    """
    pass

# Use async/await for I/O operations
async def receive_messages() -> List[Message]:
    """Async message reception from network."""
    pass
```

#### **TypeScript/React (Frontend)**
```typescript
// Use strict TypeScript
interface MessageProps {
  message: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  sender: string;
}

// Functional components with hooks
const MessageComponent: React.FC<MessageProps> = ({ message, timestamp, sender }) => {
  return (
    <div className="message">
      <span className="sender">{sender}</span>
      <span className="content">{message}</span>
      <span className="time">{timestamp.toLocaleString()}</span>
    </div>
  );
};
```

### **Commit Guidelines**

**Use conventional commits:**
```bash
feat: add voice call capability
fix: resolve mesh routing loop issue
docs: update installation guide
test: add spectrum analyzer tests
refactor: optimize RF protocol handling
```

**Commit message format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Examples:**
```bash
feat(rf): implement adaptive frequency hopping

Add frequency hopping capability to avoid interference
and improve network resilience in congested RF environments.

Closes #123
```
