# üì± SMS Reception Issue Resolution Guide

## üîç Problem Analysis

Based on our diagnostics, here's what's happening with your SMS reception:

1. **Your system is receiving SMS attempts** - Messages are being stored in the database
2. **SIGTRAN transmission is failing** - Because the system is configured with placeholder values instead of real carrier information
3. **Frontend should display messages** - Even failed ones, but there might be a connection issue

## üìã Current Status

- Backend API: ‚úÖ Running on http://localhost:8083
- Frontend: ‚úÖ Accessible on http://localhost:8080
- Authentication: ‚úÖ Working with admin/telecom2025
- Messages in system: ‚úÖ Found 10+ messages
- SS7 Mode: ‚ö†Ô∏è SIGTRAN enabled but not properly configured

## üîß Root Cause

Your system is running in **SIGTRAN mode** (SS7 over IP) which requires:
1. Real carrier point codes
2. Carrier IP addresses
3. Authentication credentials
4. Proper TLS certificates

Currently, these are set to placeholder values in `sigtran_config.py`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions

### Option 1: For Testing (Recommended)
Switch to private network simulation mode which doesn't require carrier connectivity:

1. Modify the startup script to use private network mode:
```powershell
# In start-fullstack.ps1, change these lines:
$env:SS7_SIGTRAN = "false"
$env:SS7_PRIVATE_NETWORK = "true"
```

2. Restart the services:
```bash
# Close all PowerShell windows
# Run start-fullstack.ps1 again
```

### Option 2: For Production with Real Carrier
Update `sigtran_config.py` with actual carrier information:

1. Contact your telecommunications carrier for:
   - Point codes for STP, MSC nodes
   - IP addresses of carrier equipment
   - Authentication credentials
   - TLS certificates

2. Update `sigtran_config.py` with real values:
   - Replace placeholder point codes
   - Replace IP addresses
   - Add authentication credentials
   - Configure TLS certificates

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

1. **Verify backend is receiving messages**:
   ```bash
   # Check messages via API
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8083/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "telecom2025"}'
   # Use returned token to check messages
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" http://localhost:8083/api/sms/messages
   ```

2. **Check frontend connection**:
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for JavaScript errors
   - Check Network tab for failed API requests to localhost:8083

3. **Test message flow**:
   - Send test SMS through web interface
   - Verify it appears in messages list
   - Check if status shows "sent" or has error details

## üìû Receiving SMS from Your Mobile Phone

To receive actual SMS from your mobile phone:

1. **Provision a real telephone number** with a carrier that supports:
   - Direct-to-app SMS routing
   - Webhook or API integration
   - SS7 connectivity (requires carrier partnership)

2. **Configure carrier endpoints** in your SIGTRAN configuration

3. **Deploy with SSL/TLS certificates** for production use

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **SIMULATION vs PRODUCTION**: The current setup is for licensed telecommunications use only
- **Legal Requirements**: Operating a real SS7 network requires proper telecommunications licenses
- **Security**: Production SS7 networks require enterprise-grade security measures

## üÜò Immediate Next Steps

1. **For testing without carrier connectivity**:
   - Set SS7_SIGTRAN=false and SS7_PRIVATE_NETWORK=true
   - Restart services
   - Test SMS through web interface

2. **Check frontend display**:
   - Open browser developer tools
   - Check for JavaScript errors
   - Verify API calls to backend are successful

3. **Verify message storage**:
   - Messages should appear in the web interface even if SS7 transmission fails
   - Look for messages with "SIGTRAN transmission failed" status

If you continue to have issues seeing messages in the frontend, please check the browser console for errors and ensure the frontend is properly connecting to the backend API at http://localhost:8083.
