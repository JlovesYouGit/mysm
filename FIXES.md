# Fixes for Spectrum Frontend Scan and Number Assignment Issues

## Issues Identified

1. **Spectrum Frontend Scan Failed**: The spectrum analysis functionality in the frontend was failing because:
   - The spectrum API endpoints were in a separate service ([main_simple.py](file:///N:/sms/main_simple.py)) running on port 8084
   - The frontend API service was trying to access spectrum endpoints on port 8083 where the main API runs
   - The two services weren't properly coordinated

2. **Generate New Function Failed to Assign Number**: This was likely a side effect of the spectrum service not running properly, as the spectrum analysis is supposed to generate new phone numbers.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Updated Frontend API Service
Modified [N:/sms/Frontend components/nexus-dialer-hub/src/lib/api.ts](file:///N:/sms/Frontend%20components/nexus-dialer-hub/src/lib/api.ts) to:
- Use separate base URLs for main API (port 8083) and spectrum API (port 8084)
- Added `VITE_SPECTRUM_API_BASE_URL` environment variable support
- Created [.env.local](file:///N:/sms/Frontend%20components/nexus-dialer-hub/.env.local) file with spectrum API configuration

### 2. Updated Start Script
Modified [start-fullstack.ps1](file:///N:/sms/start-fullstack.ps1) to:
- Start both backend services (main API on port 8083 and spectrum API on port 8084)
- Kill processes on both ports when restarting
- Provide clear status messages for both services

### 3. Fixed Number Service
Fixed an issue in [number_service.py](file:///N:/sms/number_service.py) where database objects were being incorrectly tested for truthiness, which was causing connection issues.

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. **Restart the Full Stack**:
   ```powershell
   .\start-fullstack.ps1
   ```

2. **Verify Services are Running**:
   ```powershell
   netstat -ano | findstr "8083\|8084"
   ```
   You should see both ports listening.

3. **Test the Spectrum Scan**:
   - Open the application at http://localhost:8080
   - Navigate to the Spectrum page
   - Click "Start Spectrum Scan"
   - The scan should now complete successfully

4. **Test Number Assignment**:
   - Navigate to the Numbers page
   - Click "Get New Number"
   - Select a number from the available list
   - Click "Assign"
   - The number should be successfully assigned to your account

## Additional Notes

- The spectrum analysis service ([main_simple.py](file:///N:/sms/main_simple.py)) runs on port 8084
- The main API service ([main.py](file:///N:/sms/main.py)) runs on port 8083
- Both services need to be running for full functionality
- MongoDB must be running for persistent storage
- If you encounter any issues, check the PowerShell windows that open when running the start script for error messages
